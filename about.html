      This is a simple webpage displaying a small collection of traditional Brazilian Food. As part of the <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes" target="_blank">Odin Project Foundations curriculum</a>, the students are requested to create a very simple recipe website in order to practice the HTML content taught. That's how this website came to exist. It is my personal solution to the first project proposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website's style was built after the <em>Learn Basic CSS by Building a Cafe Menu</em> tutorial from <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/" target="_blank">freeCodeCamp.org</a>. The images were downloaded from <a href="https://pixabay.com/pt/">PixaBay</a>. The Icons came from <a href="https://freeicons.io/">FreeIcons</a> and <a href="https://icons.getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap Icons</a>. They were adapted using <a href="https://inkscape.org/">inkscape</a> to better fit the page's style.
