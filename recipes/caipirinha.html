        <strong lang="pt-BR">Caipirinha</strong> is Brazil's national cocktail, made with <em lang="pt-BR">cachaça</em> (sugarcane hard liquor), sugar, and lime. The drink is prepared by mixing the fruit and the sugar together, then adding the liquor. This can be made in a single large glass to be shared among people, or in a larger jar, from which it is served in individual glasses.

        It is very refreshing and delicious. Some people may want to try it with <a href="feijoada.html" lang="pt-BR">feijoada</a>. However, keep in mind that it has a lot of alcohol, so remember: never drive after drinking.
