# Odin-Recipes

As part of the [Odin Project Foundations curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations), the students are requested to create a very simple recipe website in order to practice the html content taught. That's how this website came to exist. It is my personal solution to the first project proposed. 

This is a simple webpage displaying a small collection of traditional Brazilian Food. The page isn't much appealing to the eyes and there's a simple explanation for that: This website is made using only basic html elements such as headings, paragraphs, ordered and unordered lists, images and links.

As I go forward into the Fundamental curriculum, I might come back and add some CSS into this project. So, if you are reading this in the future, you already know the final result.

Thanks for reading.
